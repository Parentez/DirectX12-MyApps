# DirectX12-MyApps

<img src="Images/BoxRender.png" >

A simple box rendered using DirectX 12 API, created following the first chapters of the book "Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 12", which I used for studying both directX12 and some concepts of c++. The idea behind this repo is to transform it, in the course of the next two years, in a small graphics engine.

To run it, open the BoxRenderer folder and compile Main.cpp
The controls are LMB to rotate the camera and RMB to zoom in and out. Press "W" To change model view to wireframe.
